# Coffee_sales
This project leverages a real-world dataset of coffee sales from a vending machine (covering transactions from March 2024 onward) to investigate purchasing patterns, temporal trends, and customer behaviors. The goal is to derive actionable insights for optimizing operations, such as restocking, pricing, and promotions.
